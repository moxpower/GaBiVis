# GaBi Visualization
Task: Visualize GaBi data in D3

Starting from a 'GaBi balance' LCA export in xls format, I want to create simple interactive D3 visualizations (using Python, MongoDB, D3).

First working remotely I will try to upload results as shown by Adil: http://adilmoujahid.com/posts/2015/01/interactive-data-visualization-d3-dc-python-mongodb/
